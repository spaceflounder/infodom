### Because I Play Applesauce

:::dropcap
None of the kids at my school had ever heard of Applesauce. I mean the
card game, not the food. But Gladys had. We played together on recess,
in between wallball and hiding from bullies like Tom Dogger.
:::

Then one day she invited me to visit her Aunt Ding.

:::aside
Type :kbd[ding] to continue, or, if youâ€˜ve played before, type :kbd[start] to
skip straight to the cliffside.
