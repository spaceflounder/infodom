Arrr! is a one-word parser game. This means you can control the game story
by entering single word commands. Each turn, the game will present you with
text of what’s currently happening in the story.
:::

What commands the game understands depends on context. If you’re talking to
a character, you might try entering a topic. You can type a location to make
the player character go there (if that’s possible!) Other commands may be
suggested. If the game can understand the command you’ve typed, a little
preview message will appear. Press Enter to send the command to the game
and see what happens next!
